A very simple and badly written plugin for a 1.12.2 minecraft spigot server. can do the following:
players can use the "/setSteckbrief <name><profession><age>" command to set thier name, profession and age (in roleplay)
anything that can excecute commands can use "/Setckbrief <playerName>" to get the preveously set values printed in chat / console
all the boilerplate text is german only
made ~2021
